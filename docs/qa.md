- Deleted note does not return after refresh.

## Milestone 4 - Search and Quick Jump
1. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + K` to open search.
2. Search for a known phrase in one note.
3. Select result.

Expected:
- Result list updates quickly as you type.
- Selecting a result centers and highlights the target note.

## Milestone 5 - Clusters and Zones
1. Click `New Zone` twice.
2. Drag and resize zones.
3. Click `Detect Clusters`.
4. Refresh page.

Expected:
- Zone position and size persist after refresh.
- Cluster outlines appear without moving notes.

## Milestone 6 - Export
1. Click `Export`.
2. Export PNG with `Current view` and verify downloaded image.
3. Export PNG with `Whole wall`.
4. Select a zone and export PNG with `Selected zone`.
5. Export Markdown.

Expected:
- PNG files match rendered styling/content.
- Markdown file includes note text and metadata.

## Smart Links - Directed Graphs
1. Create at least three notes.
2. Select first note, click `Start Link` (or press `Ctrl/Cmd + L`), then click second note.
3. Repeat to create a second link from second note to third note.
4. Change link type dropdown (`Cause -> Effect`, `Dependency`, `Idea -> Execution`) and create one link of each type.
5. Click a note in the chain and confirm only related path links remain emphasized.
6. Refresh page.
7. Select a link arrow and press `Delete`, then refresh again.
8. Right-click a link arrow and choose `Change Type`, then right-click again and choose `Delete link`.

Expected:
- Arrows render directionally between notes with type-specific styling.
- Selecting a note highlights upstream/downstream graph paths and dims unrelated links.
- Links persist after refresh.
- Deleting a selected link removes it permanently.
- Right-click menu appears on links with actions applied immediately.

## Structure Primitives - Tags, Templates, Zone Groups
1. Select a note and add two tags via the `Tags` input in the top bar.
2. Open search (`Ctrl/Cmd + K`) and search by one of those tags.
3. Choose each template in the template dropdown and click `Apply Template`.
4. Select one zone, enter a group name in `Zone Groups` panel, then click `Group Zone`.
5. Assign another zone to the same group using the `Selected Zone Group` dropdown.
6. Collapse that group in the panel and verify grouped zones and overlapping notes are hidden.
7. Expand group and verify content returns.
8. Refresh page.
9. Add the same tag to at least two notes and verify an automatic `Tag Groups (Auto)` entry appears.
10. Click the tag-group entry and verify camera jumps to the grouped notes.

Expected:
- Tags are displayed on notes and searchable.
- Template creates a pre-structured layout with zones, notes, and grouped zones.
- Collapsing a zone group hides grouped zones and notes inside those zones.
- Zone groups, assignments, and collapse state persist after refresh.
- Tags with 2+ notes are shown as automatic groups with outlines and panel entries.

## Multi-Select Workflows
1. Enable `Box Select` and drag over several notes.
2. Verify selected count appears in header.
3. Apply a color swatch and confirm all selected notes change color.
4. Add a tag and confirm all selected notes receive the tag.
5. Drag one selected note and confirm the full selection moves together.
6. Use align/distribute buttons and verify layout updates accordingly.
7. Open export modal and choose `Selected notes` PNG scope.
8. Export Markdown and confirm selected notes are exported.

Expected:
- Box selection selects intersecting notes.
- Bulk operations apply consistently to all selected notes.
- Align/distribute actions only activate when enough notes are selected.
- Selected-notes export works for both PNG and Markdown.

## Faster Capture
1. Open quick capture with `Q` (or `Ctrl/Cmd + J`).
2. Enter 3 lines (include inline tags such as `#idea` on one line).
3. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` to capture.
4. Re-open quick capture and use `Paste -> Notes` with multi-line clipboard text.
5. If browser supports speech recognition, click `Voice to Notes`, speak two short lines, stop, then capture.

Expected:
- One line becomes one note near viewport center.
- Inline `#tags` are parsed into note tags.
- Clipboard multi-line input creates multiple notes.
- Voice transcripts are appended into quick-capture text and can be captured as notes.

## Undo/Redo History
1. Create three notes and move one note.
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Z` repeatedly and confirm actions revert in reverse order.
3. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + Z` (or `Ctrl/Cmd + Y`) and confirm actions reapply.
4. After one undo, make a brand-new edit (for example, add a tag).
5. Press redo shortcut.

Expected:
- Undo restores previous states reliably.
- Redo reapplies undone states.
- New edits after undo clear redo stack (recovery safety against branching confusion).

## Time-Based Views
1. Make several edits over 1-2 minutes (create notes, move notes, change tags/colors).
2. Toggle timeline mode (`T`) and verify timeline controls appear at the bottom.
3. Drag timeline slider backward and confirm wall state rewinds.
4. Click `Play` and verify snapshots replay forward.
5. Toggle heatmap (`H`) and confirm recently updated notes appear warmer/stronger.
6. Verify GitHub-style calendar heatmap appears and click a highlighted day to jump timeline.
7. Exit timeline mode and verify editing is enabled again.

Expected:
- Timeline mode is navigable with slider and playback.
- Playback reflects historical snapshots in order.
- Heatmap visually emphasizes recently changed notes.
- Calendar heatmap mirrors GitHub-style day grid and supports day-based timeline jump.
- Timeline mode is read-only for wall mutations.

## Keyboard Accessibility Spot Check

6. Press `T` and `H` to toggle time-based views.
